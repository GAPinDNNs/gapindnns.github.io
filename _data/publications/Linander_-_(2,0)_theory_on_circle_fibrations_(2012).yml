  We consider (2, 0) theory on a manifold M 6 that is a fibration of a spatial
  S 1 over some five-dimensional base manifold M 5. Initially, we study the free
  (2, 0) tensor multiplet which can be described in terms of classical equations
  of motion in six dimensions. Given a metric on M 6 the low energy effective
  theory obtained through dimensional reduction on the circle is a Maxwell
  theory on M 5. The parameters describing the local geometry of the fibration
  are interpreted respectively as the metric on M 5, a non-dynamical U(1) gauge
  field and the coupling strength of the resulting low energy Maxwell theory.
  We derive the general form of the action of the Maxwell theory by integrating
  the reduced equations of motion, and consider the symmetries of this theory
  originating from the superconformal symmetry in six dimensions. Subsequently, we
  consider a non-abelian generalization of the Maxwell theory on M 5. Completing
  the theory with Yukawa and Ï• 4 terms, and suitably modifying the supersymmetry
  transformations, we obtain a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory which includes
  terms related to the geometry of the fibration.
