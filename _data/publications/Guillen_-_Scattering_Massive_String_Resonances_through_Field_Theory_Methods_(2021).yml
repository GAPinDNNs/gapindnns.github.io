  We present a new method, exact in $$\alpha'$$, to explicitly compute string tree-level amplitudes involving one massive state and any number of massless ones. 
  This construction relies on the so-called twisted heterotic string, which admits only gauge multiplets, a gravitational multiplet, 
  and a single massive supermultiplet in its spectrum. In this simplified model, we determine the moduli-space integrand of all amplitudes 
  with one massive state using Berends-Giele currents of the gauge multiplet. These integrands are then straightforwardly mapped to 
  gravitational amplitudes in the twisted heterotic string and to the corresponding massive amplitudes of the conventional type-I and 
  type-II superstrings.
