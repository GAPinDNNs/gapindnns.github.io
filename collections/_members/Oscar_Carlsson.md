## About me
Points to raise
- background in theoretical physics
- final year
- supervisor/in the group of [Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html) 
- interests in geometry in machine learning in general and specifically for equivariance and more in the structure than specific implementations (refer to the review paper and the equivariance paper, as well as the ongoing research on general equivariant transformers and link to [Elias Nyholm](Elias_Nyholm.html).)
- also interested in concrete programming problems (word this in a way that is not directly contradicting the above point) such as spherical computer vision (refer to the heal-swin paper)

As a last year PhD student under [Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html) 

Draft 1:
During my years as a PhD student (feels like this implies that I'm done) under [Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html) I have explored different areas of geometric deep learning. From this I have learnt that I have a strong interest in wherever geometry intersects with machine learning, but specifically when we can utilise symmetries for equivariant neural networks and hence achieving <insert stuff>. In general I am more interested in the mathematical structures in and behind equivariant networks (refer to the review paper), but this has not stopped me from pursuing multiple more practical problems for equivariance and spherical computer vision (refer to other papers). As a last year PhD student I am currently working with [Elias_Nyholm](Elias_Nyholm.html) and [Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html) on a project investigating mathematical structures in general equivariant transformers.
