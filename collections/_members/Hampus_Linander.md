## About me

I am a machine learning researcher specializing in geometric deep learning and
uncertainty quantification for artificial neural networks.

My journey began with a PhD in theoretical physics, where I explored string
theory and higher spin using symbolic computational methods. I have developed
perception models for autonomous driving using artificial neural networks and
researched interdisciplinary problems in machine learning, mathematics, physics
and computer science.
