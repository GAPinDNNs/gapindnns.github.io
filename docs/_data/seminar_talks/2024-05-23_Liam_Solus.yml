    The field of causality has recently emerged as a subject of interest in
    machine learning, largely due to major advances in data collection methods in
    the biological sciences and tech industries where large-scale observational and
    experimental data sets can now be efficiently and ethically obtained. The
    modern approach to causality decomposes the inference process into two
    fundamental problems: the inference of causal relations between variables in
    a complex system and the estimation of the causal effect of one variable on
    another given that such a relation exists. The subject of this talk will be the
    former of the two problems, commonly called causal discovery, where the aim is
    to learn a complex causal network from the available data. We will give a soft
    introduction to the basics of causal modeling and causal discovery,
    highlighting where combinatorics and geometry have already started to
    contribute. Going deeper, we will analyze how and when geometry and
    combinatorics help us identify causal structure without the use of experimental
    data.
