## About me
I am a Technical Expert in Deep Learning at Zenseact and an Adjunct Associate Professor in Machine Learning at Chalmers University of Technology. My background in string theory and theoretical particle physics, acquired through my PhD at Chalmers and research positions at CERN, Madrid, and Brussels, has evolved into a focus on deep learning for autonomous driving, specifically in perception, prediction, planning, and simulation, with the overarching goal to eliminate road traffic crashes.
In my adjunct role, Iâ€™m particularly interested in the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning, with a focus on geometric deep learning and equivariant neural networks. My research aims to leverage symmetries to improve learning efficiency for complex, high-dimensional data, particularly in data-limited scenarios. I am driven to bridge theoretical advancements with real-world applications to enhance the robustness and scalability of deep learning across both academic and industrial domains.
 
Below are my publications in collaboration with the GAPinDNNs research group at Chalmers.
