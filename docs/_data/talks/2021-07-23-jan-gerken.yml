title: "Diffeomorphic Explanations with Normalizing Flows"
date: '2021-07-23'
abstract: "Normalizing flows are diffeomorphisms which
are parameterized by neural networks. As a result,
they can induce coordinate transformations in the
tangent space of the data manifold. In this work,
we demonstrate that such transformations can be
used to generate interpretable explanations for de-
cisions of neural networks. More specifically, we
perform gradient ascent in the base space of the
flow to generate counterfactuals which are clas-
sified with great confidence as a specified target
class. We analyze this generation process theo-
retically using Riemannian differential geometry
and establish a rigorous theoretical connection be-
tween gradient ascent on the data manifold and in
the base space of the flow."
