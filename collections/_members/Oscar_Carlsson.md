## About me
During my years as a PhD student under [Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html) I
have explored many different areas of geometric deep learning. From this I have
learnt that I have a strong interest in wherever geometry intersects with
machine learning, but specifically when we can utilise symmetries in the task to
enhance the models. This is the field of equivariant neural networks. Although I
am in general more interested in the mathematical structures in and behind
equivariant networks (see our paper "Geometric deep learning and equivariant
neural networks"), this has not stopped me from pursuing multiple more practical
problems for equivariance and spherical computer vision (see the papers
"Equivariance versus Augmentation for Spherical Images" and "HEAL-SWIN: A Vision
Transformer On The Sphere"). Currently, as a last year PhD student, I am working
with [Elias Nyholm](Elias_Nyholm.html) and [Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html)
on a project investigating mathematical structures in general equivariant
transformers.


My research is supported by the *Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software
Program (WASP)*.
