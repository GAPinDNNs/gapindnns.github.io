abstract: The standard convolutional layer in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) arises from a general linear map constrained by translation equivariance. This constraint leads to the classical weight-sharing property of the integration kernel. Interestingly, one can also derive this property from a purely differential geometry viewpoint. In this talk, I will present this alternative derivation for the weight-sharing constraint of the standard CNN and then extend this framework to a more general setting using biprincipal bundles. Finally, I will discuss how this differential geometry framework connects to established approaches for equivariant CNNs on homogeneous spaces.
