# About me

I obtained my PhD in 2019 at ICTP South American Institute for Fundamental Research. In 2020, I joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Uppsala University as a postdoctoral researcher. I started a new postdoctoral position in 2024 in the departments of Algebra and Geometry, and Analysis and Probability Theory at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg, respectively.

My main research on AI focuses on mathematical or physics-based formulations of foundational aspects of Deep Learning, e.g:

- Field theory descriptions of finite-width neural networks
- Effective field theory formulations of neural scaling laws in LLMs.
- Connections between equivariant neural networks and gauge theories.

I am also interested in finding efficient methods for computing massless and massive string scattering amplitudes, as well as in describing M-Theory interactions with pure spinors.
