abstract: "High-resolution wide-angle images, such as fisheye
images, are increasingly important in applications like
robotics and autonomous driving. Traditional
neural networks struggle with these images due to
projection and distortion losses when operating on
their flat projections. In this presentation, I will
introduce the HEAL-SWIN model, which addresses this
issue by combining the SWIN transformer with the
Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelation
(HEALPix) grid from astrophysics. This integration
enables the HEAL-SWIN model to process inherently
spherical data without projections, effectively
eliminating distortion losses."
