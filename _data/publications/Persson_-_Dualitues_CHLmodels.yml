abstract: We define a very general class of CHL-models associated with any string theory (bosonic or supersymmetric) compactified on an internal CFT C x T^d. We take the orbifold by a pair (g,\delta), where g is a (possibly non-geometric) symmetry of C and \delta is a translation along T^d. We analyze the T-dualities of these models and show that in general they contain Atkin-Lehner type symmetries. This generalizes our previous work on N=4 CHL-models based on heterotic string theory on T^6 or type II on K3 x T^2, as well as the `monstrous' CHL-models based on a compactification of heterotic string theory on the Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman CFT V^{\natural}.
