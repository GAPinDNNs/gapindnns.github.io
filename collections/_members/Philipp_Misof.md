## About me

As part of [Jan Gerken's](Jan_Gerken.html) group, my research lies in the area of mathematical
foundations of deep learning. I'm particularly interested in geometric
descriptions of neural networks (NNs), e.g. **group-equivariant NNs**, allowing for
better-tailored algorithms, as well as in the regime of wide neural networks
that is governed by the **neural tangent kernel**. Owing to my physics background,
my work is influenced by symmetry-centered approaches typically found in
mathematical physics and quantum field theory. Possible applications in
condensed matter physics and autonomous driving are also part of my interests.
My research is supported by the *Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software
Program (WASP)*.
