    Visualization and uncertainty quantification are often used to support our interpretation of deep learning models. 
    In this talk, we show through examples how both visualization and uncertainty quantification can lead to 
    misinterpretation if applied na√Øvely. Our examples will include equivariant neural networks for graphs 
    and images, as well as uncertainty quantification with structured label variation.
