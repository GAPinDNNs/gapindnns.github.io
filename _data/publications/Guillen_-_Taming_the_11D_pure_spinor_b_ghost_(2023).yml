  We provide an alternative compact expression for the 11D pure spinor b-ghost by introducing a new set of negative ghost number operators 
  made out of non-minimal pure spinor variables. Using the algebraic properties satisfied by these operators, it will be straightforwardly 
  shown that $$\{Q, b\} = \frac{P^{2}}{2}$$, as well as $$\{b, b\} = QÎ©$$. As an application of this novel formulation, the ghost number two 
  vertex operator will easily be obtained in a completely covariant manner from a standard descent relation, the ghost number three vertex 
  operator will be shown to satisfy the generalized Siegel gauge condition, and the 11D supergravity two-particle superfield will be 
  constructed in a quite simple way.
