  The $$ D=11 $$ pure spinor formulation of the superparticle allows a simple realization of covariant quantization, unlike the $$ D=11 $$ Brink-Schwarz-like
   superparticle. We explicitly show the equivalence between the cohomologies of these two models in the context of two different group decompositions: $$ SO(10,1) \rightarrow SO(1,1)\times SO(9)$$
    and $$ SO(10,1) \rightarrow SO(3,1)\times SO(7)$$. We also carry out a light-cone analysis of the pure spinor cohomology, and show that it correctly reproduces the $$SO(9)$$ equations of motion 
    for $$D=11$$ linearized supergravity.
