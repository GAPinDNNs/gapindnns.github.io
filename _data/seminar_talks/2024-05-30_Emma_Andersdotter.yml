    Neural ODEs are neural network models where the network is not specified by
    a discrete sequence of hidden layers. Instead, the network is defined by
    a vector field describing how the data evolves continuously over time
    governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). These models can be
    generalized for data living on non-Euclidean manifolds, a concept known as
    manifold neural ODEs. In our paper, we develop a geometric framework for
    equivariant manifold neural ODEs. Our work includes a novel formulation of
    equivariant neural ODEs in terms of differential invariants, based on Lie
    theory for symmetries of differential equations. We also construct
    augmented manifold neural ODEs and show that they are universal
    approximators of equivariant diffeomorphisms on any path-connected
    manifold.
