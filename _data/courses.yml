  title: Mathematical Structures of Deep Neural Networks
  description: |
    The goal of this course is to give an overview of mathematical structures
    that appear in modern deep neural networks and how these can be used to
    understand neural networks theoretically. The course is aimed at students
    familiar with advanced mathematics but not machine learning.

    At the end of the course, the students should be able to understand current
    research literature in the field and carry out their own projects in deep
    learning.

    The course starts with a concise introduction to deep learning, followed by
    deeper dives into the topics of equivariant neural networks, large width
    neural networks and geometrical aspects of explainable AI. Additional
    lectures cover the practical aspects of implementing neural network
    training on Google Cloud infrastructure. The lectures are accompanied by
    exercise sessions and homework assignments, where students gain hands-on
    experience with training neural networks. The course is graded with
    a project.
