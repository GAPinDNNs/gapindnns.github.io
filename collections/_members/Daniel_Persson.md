## About me
My research mostly involves aspects of group theory and representation theory in various contexts. I work on mathematical aspects of AI, with focus on geometric deep learning. I also work on automorphic forms and their Fourier coefficients, with motivation from the connection to scattering amplitudes in QFT and string theory.
Some of my current research projects include:
- Equivariant attention in transformer networks
- Spherical transformers with applications to weather data 
- Equivariant neural ODEs
- Fourier coefficients of next-to-mininal automorphic representations
- Eisenstein series attached to quaterionic discrete series
- Automorphic forms satisfying Poisson-type differential equations


Below I list my publications and talks. I have also written a book on automorphic forms.
