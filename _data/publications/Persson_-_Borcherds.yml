 The perturbative spectrum of BPS-states in the E_8 x E_8 heterotic string theory compactified on T^2 is analysed. We show that the space of BPS-states forms a representation of a certain Borcherds algebra G which we construct explicitly using an auxiliary conformal field theory. The denominator formula of an extension G_{ext} \supset G of this algebra is then found to appear in a certain heterotic one-loop N=4 topological string amplitude. Our construction thus gives an N=4 realisation of the idea envisioned by Harvey and Moore, namely that the `algebra of BPS-states' controls the threshold corrections in the heterotic string.
