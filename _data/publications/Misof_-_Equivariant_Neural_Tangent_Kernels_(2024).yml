  Equivariant neural networks have in recent years become an important technique
  for guiding architecture selection for neural networks with many applications in
  domains ranging from medical image analysis to quantum chemistry. In particular,
  as the most general linear equivariant layers with respect to the regular representation,
  group convolutions have been highly impactful in numerous applications. Although
  equivariant architectures have been studied extensively, much less is known about
  the training dynamics of equivariant neural networks. Concurrently, neural tangent
  kernels (NTKs) have emerged as a powerful tool to analytically understand the training
  dynamics of wide neural networks. In this work, we combine these two fields for
  the first time by giving explicit expressions for NTKs of group convolutional neural
  networks. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate superior performance for equivariant
  NTKs over non-equivariant NTKs on a classification task for medical images.
