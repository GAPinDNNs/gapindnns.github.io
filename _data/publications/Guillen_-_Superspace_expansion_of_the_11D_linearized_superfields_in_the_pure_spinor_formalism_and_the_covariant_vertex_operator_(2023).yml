abstract: |
  11D pure spinors have been shown to successfully describe 11D supergravity in a manifestly super-Poincaré covariant manner. 
  The feasibility of its actual usage for scattering amplitude computations requires an efficient manipulation of the superfields
  defining linearized 11D supergravity. In this paper, we directly address this problem by finding the superspace expansions of 
  these superfields, at all orders in θ, from recursive relations their equations of motion obey in Harnad-Shnider-like gauges. After 
  introducing the 11D analogue of the 10D $$\mathcal{A}\mathcal{B}\mathcal{C}$$ superparticle, we construct, for the first time, a fully 
  covariant vertex operator for 11D supergravity by making use of the linearized 11D superfields. Notably, we show that this vertex 
  reproduces the Green-Gutperle-Kwon 11D operators in light-cone gauge.
