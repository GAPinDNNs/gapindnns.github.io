abstract: In this paper we analyze Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms on a finite cover G of an adelic split simply-laced group. Let π be a minimal or next-to-minimal automorphic representation of G. We prove that any η∈π is completely determined by its Whittaker coefficients with respect to (possibly degenerate) characters of the unipotent radical of a fixed Borel subgroup, analogously to the Piatetski-Shapiro--Shalika formula for cusp forms on GLn. We also derive explicit formulas expressing the form, as well as all its maximal parabolic Fourier coefficient in terms of these Whittaker coefficients. A consequence of our results is the non-existence of cusp forms in the minimal and next-to-minimal automorphic spectrum. We provide detailed examples for G of type D5 and E8 with a view towards applications to scattering amplitudes in string theory.
