  Using the pure spinor master action for 10D super-Yang-Mills in the gauge $$b_{0}V = QÎž$$, tree-level scattering amplitudes 
  are calculated through the perturbiner method, and shown to match those obtained from pure spinor CFT techniques. 
  We find kinematic numerators made of nested b-ghost operators, and show that the Siegel gauge condition $$b_{0}V = 0$$ gives rise to 
  color-kinematics duality satisfying numerators whose Jacobi identity follows from the Jacobi identity of a kinematic algebra.
