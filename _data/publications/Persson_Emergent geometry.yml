abstract: We consider supergravity in five-dimensional Anti-De Sitter space AdS5 with minimal supersymmetry, encoded by a Sasaki-Einstein metric on a five-dimensional compact manifold M. Our main result reveals how the Sasaki-Einstein metric emerges from a canonical state in the dual CFT, defined by a superconformal gauge theory in four dimensional Minkowski space ℝ3,1in the t'Hooft limit where the rank N tends to infinity. We obtain explicit finite N−approximations to the Sasaki-Einstein metric, expressed in terms of a canonical (i.e. background free) BPS-state on the gauge theory side. We also provide a string theory interpretation of the BPS-state in question, which sheds new light on the previously noted intriguing duality of giant gravitons.
