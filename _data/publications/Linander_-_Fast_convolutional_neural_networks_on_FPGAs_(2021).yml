  We introduce an automated tool for deploying ultra low-latency, low-power deep
  neural networks with convolutional layers on field-programmable gate arrays
  (FPGAs). By extending the hls4ml library, we demonstrate an inference latency
  of 5 µs using convolutional architectures, targeting microsecond latency
  applications like those at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Considering benchmark
  models trained on the Street View House Numbers Dataset, we demonstrate various
  methods for model compression in order to fit the computational constraints of
  a typical FPGA device used in trigger and data acquisition systems of particle
  detectors. In particular, we discuss pruning and quantization-aware training,
  and demonstrate how resource utilization can be significantly reduced with
  little to no loss in model accuracy. We show that the FPGA critical resource
  consumption can be reduced by 97% with zero loss in model accuracy, and by 99%
  when tolerating a 6% accuracy degradation.
