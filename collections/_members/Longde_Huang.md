## About me
My current research focuses on the theoretical sides of **equivariant neural networks**, in particular on the trade-off between enforcing symmetry through **data augmentation** and through **manifestly equivariant architectures**. More concretely, I view the training dynamic as a stochastic process, and aim to understand the asymptotic symmetry properties emerging from random sampling and parameter initialization.

My background prior to this is in mathematics and topology*, which has motivated me to work on gauge-equivariant neural networks for predicting **topological invariants of multiband insulators**, and studying the symmetry derived from mathematics and physics. These experiences continue to shape my current research, where I have reoriented my self to explore more general and abstract structures underneath, and develop a theoretical framework for equivariance of neural networks.

My research is supported by the *Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software
Program (WASP)*.
