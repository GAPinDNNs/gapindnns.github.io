  A new ambitwistor string is constructed based on a ten-dimensional supertwistor model for the massless superparticle. Although covariant quantization is complicated by reducibility issues, a light-cone gauge analysis can be easily performed. We show that with this analysis, this supertwistor ambitwistor string is equivalent to the RNS ambitwistor string in light-cone gauge. In order to make the comparison, we develop the light-cone gauge analysis of the RNS ambitwistor string which has some novel features in terms of its expression of the scattering equations through interaction point operators.
