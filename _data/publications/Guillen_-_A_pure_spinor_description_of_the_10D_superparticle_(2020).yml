  We present a novel twistor formulation of the ten-dimensional massless superparticle. This formulation is based on the introduction 
  of pure spinor variables through a field redefinition of another model for the superparticle, and in the new description we find that 
  the super-Pauli-Lubanski three-form naturally arises as a constraint. Quantization is studied in detail for both models and they are 
  shown to correctly describe the D=10 super-Yang-Mills states.
