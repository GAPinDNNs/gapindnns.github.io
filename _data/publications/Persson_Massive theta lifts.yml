abstract: We use Poincaré series for massive Maass-Jacobi forms to define a “massive theta lift”, and apply it to the examples of the constant function and the modular invariant j-function, with the Siegel-Narain theta function as integration kernel. These theta integrals are deformations of known one-loop string threshold corrections. Our massive theta lifts fall off exponentially, so some Rankin-Selberg integrals are finite without Zagier renormalization.
