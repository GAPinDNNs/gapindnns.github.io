    Our paper on *Learning Chern Numbers of Topological Insulators with Gauge Equivariant Neural Networks* has been accepted for a poster at NeurIPS 2025! In this paper, we combine lattice gauge equivariant networks with a novel training mechanism to learn topological invariants (Chern numbers) of topological insulators. This paper combines several beautiful topics in machine learning, physics and mathematics.

  headline: Open PhD Position
  text: |
    We have an open PhD position with [Jan Gerken](/members/Jan_Gerken) about symmetries in neural networks.

    We seek a PhD student for a project at the intersection of mathematics and deep learning to work on theoretical aspects of geometric deep learning. The question whether more data and compute are sufficient to improve neural networks is highly debated at the moment in all areas of deep learning. In this project, you will work on a theoretical framework which will help to better understand these questions in the context of geometric deep learning and add rigorous arguments to a debate driven by empirical results.
