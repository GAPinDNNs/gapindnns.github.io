abstract: Deep Learning is nowadays a well-stablished method for different applications in science and technology. 
          However, it has been unclear for a long time how the "learning process" actually occurs in different architectures, 
          and how this knowledge could be used to optimize performance and efficiency. Recently, high-energy-physics-based ideas 
          have been applied to the modelling of Deep Learning, thus translating the learning problem to an RG flow analysis in 
          Quantum Field Theory (QFT). In this talk, I will explain how these quite complicated formulae describing such RG flows 
          for different observables in neural networks at initialization, can be easily obtained from a few rules resembling Feynman 
          rules in QFT. I will also comment on some work in progress which implements such rules for computing higher-order corrections 
          to the frozen (infinite-width) NTK for particular activation functions, and how they evolve after a few steps of SGD.
