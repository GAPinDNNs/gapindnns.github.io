abstract: "We survey the mathematical foundations of geometric deep learning, focusing\
  \ on group equivariant and gauge equivariant neural networks. We develop gauge equivariant\
  \ convolutional neural networks on arbitrary manifolds \\(\\mathcal {M}\\) using\
  \ principal bundles with structure group K and equivariant maps between sections\
  \ of associated vector bundles. We also discuss group equivariant neural networks\
  \ for homogeneous spaces \\(\\mathcal {M}=G/K\\), which are instead equivariant\
  \ with respect to the global symmetry \\(G\\) on \\(\\mathcal {M}\\). Group equivariant\
  \ layers can be interpreted as intertwiners between induced representations of \\(G\\),\
  \ and we show their relation to gauge equivariant convolutional layers. We analyze\
  \ several applications of this formalism, including semantic segmentation and object\
  \ detection networks. We also discuss the case of spherical networks in great detail,\
  \ corresponding to the case \\(\\mathcal {M}=S^2=\\textrm{SO}(3)/\\textrm{SO}(2)\\\
  ). Here we emphasize the use of Fourier analysis involving Wigner matrices, spherical\
  \ harmonics and Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients for \\(G=\\textrm{SO}(3)\\), illustrating\
  \ the power of representation theory for deep learning."
