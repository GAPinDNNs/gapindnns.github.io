abstract: We survey the mathematical foundations of geometric deep learning, focusing
  on group equivariant and gauge equivariant neural networks. We develop gauge equivariant
  convolutional neural networks on arbitrary manifolds \(\mathcal{M}\) using principal
  bundles with structure group \(K\) and equivariant maps between sections of associated
  vector bundles. We also discuss group equivariant neural networks for homogeneous
  spaces \(\mathcal{M}=G/K\), which are instead equivariant with respect to the global
  symmetry \(G\) on \(\mathcal{M}\). Group equivariant layers can be interpreted as
  intertwiners between induced representations of \(G\), and we show their relation
  to gauge equivariant convolutional layers. We analyze several applications of this
  formalism, including semantic segmentation and object detection networks. We also
  discuss the case of spherical networks in great detail, corresponding to the case
  \(\mathcal{M}=S^2=\mathrm{SO}(3)/\mathrm{SO}(2)\). Here we emphasize the use of
  Fourier analysis involving Wigner matrices, spherical harmonics and Clebsch-Gordan
  coefficients for \(G=\mathrm{SO}(3)\), illustrating the power of representation
  theory for deep learning.
