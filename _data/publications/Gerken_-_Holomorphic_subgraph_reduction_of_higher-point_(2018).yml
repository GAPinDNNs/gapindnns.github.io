abstract: Modular graph forms are a class of modular covariant functions which appear
  in the genus-one contribution to the low-energy expansion of closed string scattering
  amplitudes. Modular graph forms with holomorphic subgraphs enjoy the simplifying
  property that they may be reduced to sums of products of modular graph forms of
  strictly lower loop order. In the particular case of dihedral modular graph forms,
  a closed form expression for this holomorphic subgraph reduction was obtained previously
  by D'Hoker and Green. In the current work, we extend these results to trihedral
  modular graph forms. Doing so involves the identification of a modular covariant
  regularization scheme for certain conditionally convergent sums over discrete momenta,
  with some elements of the sum being excluded. The appropriate regularization scheme
  is identified for any number of exclusions, which in principle allows one to perform
  holomorphic subgraph reduction of higher-point modular graph forms with arbitrary
  holomorphic subgraphs.
