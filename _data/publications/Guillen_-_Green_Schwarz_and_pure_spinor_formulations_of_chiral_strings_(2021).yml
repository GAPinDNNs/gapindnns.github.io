  Bosonic and RNS chiral strings have been defined from a singular gauge fixing of the respective Polyakov and spinning string actions, enforcing, among other things, 
  the finite nature of their physical spectra. Except for the heterotic case, the tensionless limits of such chiral models have been shown 
  to describe the same field theories predicted by their ambitwistor analogues. In this paper, we study the Green-Schwarz formulation 
  for Type II and heterotic superstrings in a singular gauge. After performing a light-cone gauge analysis, their physical spectra are 
  shown to match those of RNS chiral strings, and their respective tensionless limits are found to describe the same field theories 
  predicted by RNS ambitwistor strings. Their pure spinor counterparts are then introduced by making use of the Oda-Tonin method. 
  In doing so, symmetries hidden in the pure spinor ambitwistor string action become manifest, proposals motivating the sectorized 
  pure spinor BRST charges find simple grounds, and integrated vertex operators emerge naturally.
