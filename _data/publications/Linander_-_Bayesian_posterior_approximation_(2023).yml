  We introduce ensembles of stochastic neural networks to approximate the Bayesian
  posterior, combining stochastic methods such as dropout with deep ensembles. The
  stochas-tic ensembles are formulated as families of distributions and trained
  to approximate the Bayesian posterior with variational inference. We implement
  stochastic ensembles based on Monte Carlo dropout, DropConnect and a novel
  non-parametric version of dropout and evaluate them on a toy problem and CIFAR
  image classification. For both tasks, we test the quality of the posteriors
  directly against Hamil-tonian Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that
  stochastic ensembles provide more accurate posterior esti-mates than other
  popular baselines for Bayesian inference.
