  In this talk, I will summarize my first two years of research in my PhD. Starting with an introduction to the Neural Tangent Kernel, I will later explain how we extended this to the domain of equivariant architectures and how this can be used to derive a connection between manifest equivariance and data-augmentation. The second part of the talk focuses on our most recent project: deriving finite-width corrections to the NTK by means of Feynman diagrams.
