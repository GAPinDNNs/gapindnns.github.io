title: GAPinDNNs Seminar
---

We organize the GAPinDNNs seminar at the Department for Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg.

The topics of the seminar are broad and lie at the intersection of machine learning (in particular deep learning), pure mathematics and theoretical physics. We have both more theoretical and more applied speakers. If you would like to receive invitations to upcoming talks, please let the seminar organizers know and we will add you to our email list.

Seminars usually happen in-person only on Thursdays at 10.30am. After the seminar we go for lunch with the speaker and there is a speaker dinner in the evening before or after the talk.

Current seminar organizers are [Jan Gerken](/members/Jan_Gerken) and [Max
Guillen](/members/Max_Guillen).
