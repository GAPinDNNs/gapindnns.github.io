  In this Thesis we study first- and second-quantized approaches describing $$D=11$$ supergravity using pure spinor variables. 
  We introduce the so-called $$D=11$$ pure spinor superparticle through BRST cohomology arguments starting from the semi-light-cone gauge 
  $$D=11$$ Brink-Schwarz-like superparticle. After performing a light-cone gauge analysis of the pure spinor BRST cohomology at ghost number
  three, we find the linearized equations of motion of $$D=11$$ supergravity in $$D=9$$ superspace. In addition, we construct a BRST-closed, 
  ghost number one vertex operator made out of worldline fields and $$D=11$$ supergravity superfields, and we run into an inconsistency 
  when constructing a ghost number zero vertex operator satisfying a standard descent equation. We then introduce the non-minimal version 
  of the $$D=11$$ pure spinor superparticle, in which a composite b-ghost can be constructed satisfying $$\{Q,b\}=P^{2}$$. However, its complicated 
  expression makes it difficult to check its nilpotency. We show that introducing an $$SO(1,10)$$ fermionic vector $$\bar{\Sigma}^{a}$$ 
  simplifies the form of the b-ghost considerably, which allows us to verify that $$\{Q,b\}=P^{2}$$ and $$\{b,b\}$$= BRST-exact. Using this 
  b-ghost we propose an alternative ghost number zero vertex operator satisfying a standard descent equation. However, its expression will 
  depend on non-minimal pure spinor variables in a very complicated fashion. After discussing this first-quantized approach for $$D=11$$ 
  supergravity, we move on to discussing the pure spinor master actions introduced by Cederwall for studying maximally supersymmetric 
  gauge theories. We show that these actions indeed describe $$D=10$$ super-Yang-Mills, $$D=10$$ super-Born-Infeld and $$D=11$$ supergravity
  by extracting the equations of motion in ordinary superspace for each one of these theories.
