abstract: |
  A \\(Q\\)-exact off-shell action is constructed for twisted abelian (2,0) theory
  on a Lorentzian six-manifold of the form \\(M_{1,5} = C \times M_4\\), where \\(C\\) is a flat
  two-manifold and \\(M_4\\) is a general Euclidean four-manifold. The properties of
  this formulation, which is obtained by introducing two auxiliary fields, can be
  summarised by a commutative diagram where the Lagrangian and its stress-tensor
  arise from the \\(Q\\)-variation of two fermionic quantities \\(V\\) and \\(\lambda^{\mu\nu}\\). This
  completes and extends the analysis in [[1]](#pub_Linander_-_The_trouble_with_twisting_(2_0)_theory_(2014)).
