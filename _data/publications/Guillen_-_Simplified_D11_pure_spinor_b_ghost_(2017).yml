  A b-ghost was constructed for the $$D = 11$$ non-minimal pure spinor superparticle by requiring that $$ \{Q, b\} = T$$ where $$Q = \Lambda^{\alpha}D_{\alpha} +R^{\alpha}\bar{W}_{\alpha}$$ is the usual 
  non-minimal pure spinor BRST operator. As was done for the $$D = 10$$ b-ghost, we will show that the $$D = 11$$ b-ghost can be simplified by introducing an $$SO(10, 1)$$ fermionic vector $$\bar{\Sigma}^{i}$$ 
  constructed out of the fermionic spinor $$D_{\alpha}$$ and pure spinor variables. This simplified version will be shown to satisfy $$\{Q, b\} = T$$ and $$\{b, b\} =$$ BRST - trivial.
