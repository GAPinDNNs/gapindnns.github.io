abstract: We demonstrate that deep ensembles are secretly equivariant models. More
  precisely, we show that deep ensembles become equivariant for all inputs and at
  all training times by simply using data augmentation. Crucially, equivariance holds
  off-manifold and for any architecture in the infinite width limit. The equivariance
  is emergent in the sense that predictions of individual ensemble members are not
  equivariant but their collective prediction is. Neural tangent kernel theory is
  used to derive this result and we verify our theoretical insights using detailed
  numerical experiments.
