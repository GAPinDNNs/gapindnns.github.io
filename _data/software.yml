  description: |
    HEAL-SWIN is an extension of the popular vision-transformer [SWIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030), capable of operating on high-dimensional spherical data. HEAL-SWIN uses the [HEALPix grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9812350) and has only minimal computational overhead compared to the baseline SWIN model.

    We provide a reference implementation for HEAL-SWIN focused on applications for spherical images, in particular those taken with fisheye lenses. We include a containerized training framework based on PyTorch Lightning and parameter logging with MLFlow. SLURM-based jobscripts for published reference runs and baselines are also available.
