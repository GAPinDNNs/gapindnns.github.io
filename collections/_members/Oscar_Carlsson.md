## About me
During my years as a PhD student under [Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html) I
explored many different areas of geometric deep learning. From this I have
learnt that I have a strong interest in wherever geometry intersects with
machine learning, but specifically when we can utilise symmetries in the task to
enhance the models. A special case of this is the field of equivariant neural networks. Although I
am in general more interested in the mathematical structures in and behind
equivariant networks (see our paper "Geometric deep learning and equivariant
neural networks"), this has not stopped me from pursuing multiple more practical
problems for equivariance and spherical computer vision (see the papers
"Equivariance versus Augmentation for Spherical Images" and "HEAL-SWIN: A Vision
Transformer On The Sphere"). 

For those interested in mathematical structures for non-linear layers I would recommend
my paper "Equivariant non-linear maps for neural networks on homogeneous spaces" co-written
with [Elias Nyholm](Elias_Nyholm.html), [Maurice Wiler](https://maurice-weiler.gitlab.io/), and 
[Daniel Persson](Daniel_Persson.html). This paper constructs a unifying framework allowing 
multiple well known layers (both linear and non-linear) to appear as special cases.

Additionally, please read my PhD thesis [Geometry and Symmetry in Deep Learning: From Mathematical Foundations to Vision Applications](/_pages/theses.html#thesis_Carlsson) which I successfully defended on the 29th of August 2025.

Currently I have a full time teaching position, limited to one year, at the 
Department of Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology.

My research was supported by the *Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software
Program (WASP)*.
