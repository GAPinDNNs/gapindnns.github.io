abstract: "Neural network classifiers are black box models which lack inherent interpretability. In many practical applications like medical imaging or autonomous driving, interpretations of the network decisions are needed which are provided by the field of explainable AI.Counterfactuals provide intuitive explanations for neural network classifiers which help to identify reliance on spurious features and biases in the underlying dataset.
In this talk, I will introduce Diffeomorphic Counterfactuals, a simple but effective method to generate counterfactuals. Diffeomorphic Counterfactuals are generated by performing a suitable coordinate transformation of the data space using a generative model and then gradient ascent in the new coordinates. I will present a theoretical analysis of the generation process using differential geometry and show experimental results which validate the quality of the generated counterfactuals using various qualitative and quantitative measures."
