  headline: New Preprint
  link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06504
  text: |
    The preprint "Equivariant Neural Tangent Kernels" from our group appeared on the arXiv today. We compute neural tangent kernels (NTKs) for group convolutional networks for the first time and show that equivariant NTKs outperform their non-equivariant counterparts on a medical image dataset.
