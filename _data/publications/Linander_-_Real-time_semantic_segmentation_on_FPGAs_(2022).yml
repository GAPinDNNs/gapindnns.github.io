  In this paper, we investigate how field programmable gate arrays can serve as
  hardware accelerators for real-time semantic segmentation tasks relevant for
  autonomous driving. Considering compressed versions of the ENet convolutional
  neural network architecture, we demonstrate a fully-on-chip deployment with
  a latency of 4.9 ms per image, using less than 30% of the available resources
  on a Xilinx ZCU102 evaluation board. The latency is reduced to 3 ms per image
  when increasing the batch size to ten, corresponding to the use case where the
  autonomous vehicle receives inputs from multiple cameras simultaneously. We
  show, through aggressive filter reduction and heterogeneous quantization-aware
  training, and an optimized implementation of convolutional layers, that the
  power consumption and resource utilization can be significantly reduced while
  maintaining accuracy on the Cityscapes dataset.
