title: "Geometric Deep Learning: From Pure Math to Applications"
date: '2023-04-12'
abstract: "Despite its remarkable success, deep learning is lacking a strong theoretical
foundation. One way to help alleviate this problem is to use ideas from differential geometry
and group theory at various points in the learning process to arrive at a more principled
approach of setting up the learning process. This approach goes by the name of geometric
deep learning and has received a lot of attention in recent years. In this talk, I will summarize
our work on some aspects of geometric deep learning, namely using group theory to guide
the construction of neural network architectures and using the manifold structure of the input
data to generate counterfactual explanations for neural networks motivated from differential
geometry."
