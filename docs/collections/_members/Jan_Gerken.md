## About me

I lead a research group about mathematical foundations of AI, funded by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program.

I have a background in string theory, in particular I computed string scattering amplitudes at genus one during my PhD. My current main research interests are:
- wide neural networks, neural tangent kernels and connections to quantum field theory
- mathematical aspects of geometric deep learning, ranging from the geometry of the data manifold to equivariant neural networks
- computer vision for spherical data

I am also interested in quantum chemistry and quantum computing.
