The research group on Geometry, Algebra and Physics in Deep Neural Networks
(GAPinDNNs) is based at the Department for Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers
University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. Our vision is to develop a mathematical foundation for deep learning which elevates the field into a theoretically well-grounded science.
