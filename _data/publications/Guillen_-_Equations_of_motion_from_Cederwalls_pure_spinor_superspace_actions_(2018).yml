  Using non-minimal pure spinor superspace, Cederwall has constructed BRST-invariant actions for $$D=10$$ super-Born-Infeld and $$D=11$$ supergravity which are quartic in the superfields. But since the superfields have explicit dependence on the non-minimal pure spinor variables, it is non-trivial to show these actions correctly describe super-Born-Infeld and supergravity. In this paper, we expand solutions to the equations of motion from Cederwall's actions to leading order around the linearized solutions and show that they correctly describe the interactions of $$D=10$$ super-Born-Infeld and $$D=11$$ supergravity.
