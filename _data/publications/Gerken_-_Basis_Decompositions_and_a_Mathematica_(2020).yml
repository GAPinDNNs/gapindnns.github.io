abstract: Modular graph forms (MGFs) are a class of non-holomorphic modular forms
  which naturally appear in the low-energy expansion of closed-string genus-one amplitudes
  and have generated considerable interest from pure mathematicians. MGFs satisfy
  numerous non-trivial algebraic- and differential relations which have been studied
  extensively in the literature and lead to significant simplifications. In this paper,
  we systematically combine these relations to obtain basis decompositions of all
  two- and three-point MGFs of total modular weight $$w+\bar{w}\leq12$$, starting
  from just two well-known identities for banana graphs. Furthermore, we study previously
  known relations in the integral representation of MGFs, leading to a new understanding
  of holomorphic subgraph reduction as Fay identities of Kronecker--Eisenstein series
  and opening the door towards decomposing divergent graphs. We provide a computer
  implementation for the manipulation of MGFs in the form of the Mathematica
  package ModularGraphForms which includes the basis decompositions obtained.
