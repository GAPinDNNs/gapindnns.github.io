  We study generating series of torus integrals that contain all so-called
  modular graph forms relevant for massless one-loop closed-string amplitudes. By
  analysing the differential equation of the generating series we construct a solution
  for their low-energy expansion to all orders in the inverse string tension \u03B1
  \u2032. Our solution is expressed through initial data involving multiple zeta values
  and certain real-analytic functions of the modular parameter of the torus. These
  functions are built from real and imaginary parts of holomorphic iterated Eisenstein
  integrals and should be closely related to Brown\u2019s recent construction of
  real-analytic modular forms. We study the properties of our real-analytic objects
  in detail and give explicit examples to a fixed order in the \u03B1\u2032-expansion.
  In particular, our solution allows for a counting of linearly independent modular
  graph forms at a given weight, confirming previous partial results and giving
  predictions for higher, hitherto unexplored weights. It also sheds new light on
  the topic of uniform transcendentality of the \u03B1\u2032-expansion.
