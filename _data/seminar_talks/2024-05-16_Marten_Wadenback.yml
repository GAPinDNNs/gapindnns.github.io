    We start from geometric first principles to construct a machine learning
    framework for 3D point set analysis. We argue that spherical decision
    surfaces are a natural choice for this type of problems, and we represent
    them using a non-linear embedding of 3D Euclidean space into a Minkowski
    space, represented by a 5D Euclidean space. Via classification experiments
    on a 3D Tetris dataset, we show that we can get a geometric handle on the
    network weights, allowing us to directly apply transformations to the
    network. The model is further extended into a steerable filter bank,
    facilitating classification in arbitrary poses. Additionally, we study
    equivariance and invariance properties with respect to $$O(3)$$
    transformations.
