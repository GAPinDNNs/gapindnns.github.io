    Equivariance imposes symmetry constraints on the connectivity of neural networks. 
    This talk investigates the case of equivariant networks for fields of feature vectors 
    on Euclidean spaces or other Riemannian manifolds. Equivariance is shown to lead to 
    requirements for 1) spatial (convolutional) weight sharing, and 2) symmetry constraints 
    on the shared weights themselves. We investigate the symmetry constraints imposed on 
    convolution kernels and discuss how they can be solved and implemented. A gauge theoretic formulation 
    of equivariant CNNs shows that these models are not only equivariant under global transformations, 
    but under more general local gauge transformations as well.
