  We investigate one-loop four-point scattering of non-abelian gauge bosons
  in heterotic string theory and identify new connections with the corresponding open-string
  amplitude. In the low-energy expansion of the heterotic-string amplitude, the integrals
  over torus punctures are systematically evaluated in terms of modular graph forms,
  certain non-holomorphic modular forms. For a specific torus integral, the modular
  graph forms in the low-energy expansion are related to the elliptic multiple zeta
  values from the analogous open-string integrations over cylinder boundaries. The
  detailed correspondence between these modular graph forms and elliptic multiple
  zeta values supports a recent proposal for an elliptic generalization of the single-valued
  map at genus zero.
