  We present a novel ten-dimensional description of ambitwistor strings. This formulation is based on a set of supertwistor variables involving 
  pure spinors and a set of constraints previously introduced in the context of the $$D=10$$ superparticle following a ten-dimensional 
  twistor-like construction introduced by Berkovits. We perform a detailed quantum-mechanical analysis of the constraint algebra, we show that
  the corresponding central charges vanish, and after considering a convenient gauge fixing procedure, physical states are found. 
  Vertex operators are explicitly constructed and, by noticing a relation with the standard pure spinor formalism, scattering amplitudes 
  are shown to correctly describe $$D=10$$ super-Yang-Mills interactions. As in other ambitwistor string models, amplitudes are found to be 
  localized on the support of the scattering equations, and thus this work provides a bridge between Berkovits' construction and the 
  Cachazo-He-Yuan formulae. After extending the pure spinor twistor transform to include an additional supersymmetry, our results are 
  immediately generalized to Type IIB supergravity.
