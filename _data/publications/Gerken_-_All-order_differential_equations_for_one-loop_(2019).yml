abstract: We investigate generating functions for the integrals over world-sheet tori
  appearing in closed-string one-loop amplitudes of bosonic, heterotic and type-II
  theories. These closed-string integrals are shown to obey homogeneous and linear
  differential equations in the modular parameter of the torus. We spell out the first-order
  Cauchy-Riemann and second-order Laplace equations for the generating functions for
  any number of external states. The low-energy expansion of such torus integrals
  introduces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms known as modular graph
  forms. Our results generate homogeneous first- and second-order differential equations
  for arbitrary such modular graph forms and can be viewed as a step towards all-order
  low-energy expansions of closed-string integrals.
