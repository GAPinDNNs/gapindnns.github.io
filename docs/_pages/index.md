# Welcome to our group page!
{: .display-5 }

The research group on Geometry, Algebra and Physics in Deep Neural Networks (GAPinDNNs) is based at the Department for Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers Univerity of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. Our vision is to develop a mathematical foundation for deep learning which elevates the field into a theoretically well-grounded science.

<!-- The notion of ''geometric deep learning" is often used as an umbrella term to describe various approaches to geometric theory applied to deep learning. It has been compared to the famous "Erlangen program" in mathematics, proposed by Klein in 1872 as a ''unified theory of geometry'', connecting group theory, and geometry in profound ways. -->

<!-- In a similar way, our research can be viewed as building a "unified mathematical theory of deep learning'', bringing geometry, group theory, representation theory and theoretical physics into the realm of machine learning. -->
