  We compute how small input perturbations affect the output of deep neural
  networks, exploring an analogy between deep feed-forward networks and dynamical
  systems, where the growth or decay of local perturbations is characterized
  by finite-time Lyapunov exponents. We show that the maximal exponent forms
  geometrical structures in input space, akin to coherent structures in dynamical
  systems. Ridges of large positive exponents divide input space into different
  regions that the network associates with different classes. These ridges
  visualize the geometry that deep networks construct in input space, shedding
  light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying their learning capabilities.
