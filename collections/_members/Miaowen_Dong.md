## About me

As a member of [Jan Gerken](Jan_Gerken.html)'s group, my research focuses on equivariant neural networks and data augmentation. I am broadly interested in understanding how symmetry can be exploited to design more efficient and reliable deep learning models.

With a background in applied mathematics and probabilistic methods, I aim to integrate these approaches to improve performance and explore new applications of deep learning models.

My research is supported by the *Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)*.

### Education

**MSc in Mathematics in Science and Engineering** at Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany (2025)
Thesis: *Multilevel Estimators for Rare Events with Selective Refinement Strategy*
Supervised by: Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Elisabeth Ullmann
