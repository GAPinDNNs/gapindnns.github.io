    With the Swedish summer about to end, we came together for a memorable group excursion. Thanks to the surprisingly good weather, the exploration of Gothenburg's archipelago with kayaks was a pleasant and exciting experience. A few capsizes added to the to the adventure- and are part of the learning process. To cap off the day, [Daniel Persson](/members/Daniel_Persson) treated us to an authentic Mexican-themed BBQ evening.

    [Philipp Misof](/members/Philipp_Misof) is presenting our paper *Equivariant Neural Tangent Kernels* written together with [Pan Kessel](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/pan-kessel) and [Jan Gerken](/members/Jan_Gerken) at this year's ICML in Vancouver. In this work, we extend the neural tangent kernel to equivariant neural networks and use it to draw an interesting connection between equivariant neural networks and data-augmented networks.

    The preprint *Equivariant Non-linear Maps for Neural Networks on Homogeneous Spaces* is now available on the arXiv, with authors including [Elias Nyholm](/members/Elias_Nyholm), [Oscar Carlsson](/members/Oscar_Carlsson) and [Daniel Persson](/members/Daniel_Persson). In this paper we define and study a family of equivariant neural network layers which unify convolution-based and attention-based architectures. We derive the generalised equivariance condition and show how it specialises in individual cases. The work is in collaboration with [Maurice Weiler](https://maurice-weiler.gitlab.io/).

  headline: Open PhD Position
  text: |
    We have an open PhD position with [Jan Gerken](/members/Jan_Gerken) about symmetries in neural networks.

    We seek a PhD student for a project at the intersection of mathematics and deep learning to work on theoretical aspects of geometric deep learning. The question whether more data and compute are sufficient to improve neural networks is highly debated at the moment in all areas of deep learning. In this project, you will work on a theoretical framework which will help to better understand these questions in the context of geometric deep learning and add rigorous arguments to a debate driven by empirical results.
    
    **Application Deadline is 21 May 2025.**

  text: |
    Our work on *Learning Chern Numbers of Topological Insulators with Gauge Equivariant Neural Networks* is now on the arXiv! In this paper, we combine lattice gauge equivariant networks with a novel training mechanism to learn topological invariants (Chern numbers) of topological insulators. This paper combines several beautiful topics in machine learning, physics and mathematics.

    First author is our master's student Longde Huang. Congratulations to his first publication! From our group, [Hampus Linander](/members/Hampus_Linander), [Daniel Persson](/members/Daniel_Persson) and [Jan Gerken](/members/Jan_Gerken) were also involved.
