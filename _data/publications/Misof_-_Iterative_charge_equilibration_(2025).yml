  Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics
  simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations,
  provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the
  system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation
  machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information
  about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be
  achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of
  linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size,
  making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we
  propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the
  charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We
  have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size,
  in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a
  fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended
  to be used in combination with the
  [`n2p2`](https://github.com/CompPhysVienna/n2p2) library. The method itself
  is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs.
  An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark
  system of FeCl\\(_3\\) in water.
