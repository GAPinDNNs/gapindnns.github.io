    In this talk I present an overview to my recently defended PhD thesis
    conducted within the WASP program. While artificial intelligence and deep
    learning have revolutionized many fields in the last decade, one of the key
    drivers has been access to data. This is especially true in biomedical
    image analysis where expert annotated data is hard to come by. The
    combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with data augmentation
    has proven successful in increasing the amount of training data at the cost
    of overfitting. In our research, equivariant neural networks have been used
    to extend the equivariant properties of CNNs to more transformations than
    translations. The networks have been trained and evaluated on biomedical
    image datasets, including bright-field microscopy images of cytological
    samples indicating oral cancer, and transmission electron microscopy images
    of virus samples. By designing the networks to be equivariant to e.g.
    rotations, it is shown that the need for data augmentation is reduced, that
    less overfitting occurs, and that convergence during training is faster.
    Furthermore, equivariant neural networks are more data efficient than CNNs,
    as demonstrated by scaling laws. These benefits are not present in all
    problem settings and which benefits will occur is somewhat unpredictable.
    We have identified that the results to some extent depend on architectures,
    hyperparameters and datasets. Further research may broaden the performed
    studies to explain how the results occur with new theory.
