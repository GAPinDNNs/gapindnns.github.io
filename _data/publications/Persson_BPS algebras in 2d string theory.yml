  We discuss a set of heterotic and type II string theory compactifications to
  dimensions that are characterized by factorized internal worldsheet CFTs of
  the form \\(V^{\natural}\\), where  are self-dual (super) vertex operator
  algebras. In the cases with spacetime supersymmetry, we show that the BPS
  states form a module for a Borcherds–Kac–Moody (BKM) (super)algebra, and we
  prove that for each model the BKM (super)algebra is a symmetry of genus zero
  BPS string amplitudes. We compute the supersymmetric indices of these models
  using both Hamiltonian and path integral formalisms. The path integrals are
  manifestly automorphic forms closely related to the Borcherds–Weyl–Kac
  denominator. Along the way, we comment on various subtleties inherent to
  these low-dimensional string compactifications.
