abstract: "Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) is a vast and rapidly advancing field.
 In this talk, I provide a brief introduction to GDL,
 some approaches and applications, along with a few examples.
 An essential aspect of GDL is how the model handles symmetries
 in data or spaces. For data defined on a manifold, one such
 symmetry is the choice of local coordinates and I will present our
 formulation of a convolutional layer which is equivariant to
 the choice of local coordinates (gauge equivariant) along with a
 brief overview of the required structures and concepts.
 Finally I will discuss our findings on the benefits and drawbacks
 of enforcing equivariance in the model compared to augmenting the
 training data. Based on our findings I am going to present some
 questions to consider when choosing the best approach for your models."
